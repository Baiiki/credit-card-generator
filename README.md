# credit-card-generator
To begin, we need to install all the necessary modules to generate the credit cards. `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To launch it, you just have to execute the `main.py` then write the desired number of generated credit cards.



Modules needed in the `requirements.txt` are: `random` and `time`.
